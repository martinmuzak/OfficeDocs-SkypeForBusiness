# What's the status of your port orders?

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)Microsoft Calling Plans

To see the status of your port order, in the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to  > **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, and then select **Order history**. Each port order status is listed in the **Status** column.

If the **Status** column is not listed, select the gear-shaped setting icon in the **Order history** table, and enable the **Status** column.

You can view orders that are saved but not submitted, and orders that are submitted and in progress by selecting the order name. Completed and canceled orders are not viewable, but are included in the list for record-keeping.

If you need help or if you need to inquire about an existing order, contact the [TNS Service Desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md).

When contacting the TNS Service Desk about an existing order, be sure to navigate to existing cases, select the existing case, and provide your inquiry in the case comments, rather than opening a new case about the existing order.
